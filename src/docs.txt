First Part -- Pick and Place
============================

 A number of objects (one of type pancakemix, two of type spatula)
 are to be transported from counter "kitchen_sink_block" to the
 table "pancake_table". An object of type pancakemaker resides on
 the latter, acting as collision object. This needs to be perceived
 before performing manipulation actions on this table. Picking up
 the required objects only requires knowledge about there vague
 whereabouts:
 
 (a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
               (desig-props:name "kitchen_sink_block")))
 
 (a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
               (desig-props:name "kitchen_island")))
 
 
 The script is then as follows:
 
  - Go to kitchen sink block, look at counter, query perception for objects of type 'spatula'.
  - Take spatula from counter, and query perception for objects of type 'pancakemix'.
  - Take pancake mix from counter and reposition robot in front of pancake table to detect the pancake maker.
  - Place the spatula on the pancake table with these constraints:
    
    (a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
                  (desig-props:name "pancake_table"))
                  (desig-props:rightof ,pancake-maker)))
    
  - Place the pancake mix on the kitchen island with these constrains:
    
    (a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
                  (desig-props:name "kitchen_island")))
  
  - Go to kitchen island, look at counter, query perception for objects of type 'spatula'.
  - Take second spatula and reposition robot in front of pancake table.
  - Place the spatula on the pancake table with these constraints:
    
    (a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
                  (desig-props:name "pancake_table"))
                  (desig-props:leftof ,pancake-maker)))

  - Go into a well-defined robot home-pose.

  - The final object placement and scenery looks like this:
    
                     pancake_table                    kitchen_island

    | spatula-left | pancake-maker | spatula-right |  | pancake-mix |

               |         Robot         |

Second Part -- Pancake Manipulation
===================================

 In a well-defined placement of objects, a set of manipulation
 activities has to be performed. Four objects are present on the
 pancake table:
 
  - One central object of type 'pancakemaker'
  - Two objects of type 'spatula', one to the left and one to the right of the pancake maker
  - One object of type 'pancakemix', to the right of both spatulas
 
 The robot is in a well-defines pose and position in front of the
 pancake table.
 
 The script is then as follows:
 
  - Look at the table and find the pancake maker:
 
    (an object `((desig-props:at ,(a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
                                                (desig-props:name "pancake_table"))))
                 (desig-props:type pancakemaker)))
    
  - Find the pancake mix to the right of the pancake maker:
    
    (an object `((desig-props:at ,(a location `((desig-props:on Cupboard)
                                                (desig-props:name "pancake_table"))
                                                (desig-props:rightof ,pancakemaker))))
                 (desig-props:type pancakemix)))
    
  - Grasp the pancake mix with the right arm
  - [Placeholder for pouring demo part: Pouring from the pancake mix]
  - Place the pancake mix back to the right of both spatulas
  
  - Grasp the spatula to the right of the pancake maker with the right arm
  - Grasp the spatula to the left of the pancake maker with the left arm
  
  - Query perception for objects of type 'pancake' on the pancake table, on the pancake maker.
  - [Placeholder for the flipping demo part: Flipping the pancake]
  - Place the spatula in the left hand onto its initial position left of the pancake maker.
  - Place the spatula in the right hand onto its initial position right of the pancake maker.
  
  - Done.
